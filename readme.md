# Implementation of well known Multilinear Subspace Learning Algorithms

Python notebooks implementing multilinear PCA (MPCA, UMPCA) and LDA (UMLDA) algorithms using [Tensorly](http://tensorly.org/stable/index.html).

You can find all of the implementation details along with examples the notebooks.
